    - Now using a local cache. Cache’d queries should have a much lower waiting time.
      The server should now take only about 4ms to process a query compared to up to
      the 3.9s it took before on long rosters like CS. That’s a 1000x increase! Note:
      the cache is built on demand and cleared daily.

v2.0.0
- Huge changes to /roster:
    - Removed $ objects. All their contents are dumped into the parent object.
    - Removed XML property from subject listing and replaced it with JSON property,
      with a URL to the JSON data from this API for that subject.
    - Renamed properties, dumped objects and arrays and cleaned up all over. Should
      be nice and easily usable now.


v1.1.0
- Added experimental on-the-go roster XML translation to JSON from official Cornell XML sources.
